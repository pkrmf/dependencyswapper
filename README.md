# Dependencyswapper

Dependencyswapper also known as `depswapper` is a CocoaPods plugin that allows to switch between "dev/test/prod" environments with just running a simple ruby command.

As a watchOS, tvOS and iOS Framework developer I often find myself wanting to debug my non source Frameworks to make sure the problem is not in my dependent Application/Framework. It is always time consuming to have to find the `Podfile`, then look for the git repository of the Framework I want to debug and then google the syntax to read from a git repository. With this ruby gem, the only thing you need to do is keep track of your Framework repositories and add them to the `~/.depswapper/depmapper.json` file.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dependencyswapper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dependencyswapper

## Usage

First it is very important to run a setup command. This is as simple as running `depswapper setup` in the console.

Now `depswapper` is ready to be used. Whenever you want to swap environments on any of your dependencies, run `depswapper test "NameOfYourFramework"` or `depswapper dev "NameOfYourFramework"` at the root of your Project.
